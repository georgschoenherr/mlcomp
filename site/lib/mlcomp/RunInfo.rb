# A RunInfo object provides a schema for creating a RunSpecification
# (hierarchical structures containing all the information needed to create an
# actual run).  Such a schema might be supervised learning.
#
# In practice, the user will want to make a run out of a program with a
# particular taskType, which should map to a canonical run specification for
# creating a run.  Note that the task type of the top-level program of that run
# is always Main.  The program with that taskType is the coreProgram.
#
# Some programs are just helpers and are never run directly, for example,
# evaluators (although in principle, in the future, we might want to make a
# RunInfo that allows a program to take a completed run as an argument, to do,
# for example, data analysis).
#
# There are four important subclasses, corresponding to kind (supervised-learning, performing) and (processing dataset, executing programs)
#  - SupervisedLearningRunInfo
#  - PerformingRunInfo
#  - SupervisedLearningDatasetProcessorRunInfo
#  - PerformingDatasetProcessorRunInfo
#  - GenericRunInfo
class RunInfo
  attr_accessor :run # Set later in run.rb
